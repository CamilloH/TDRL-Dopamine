Modelling instrumental learning of mice in a rule switching environment. 
Each rule is represented as one environment. After a performance threshold is reached the agent interacts with the next environment representing the next rule. 
This mimics how the mice where trained, and provides a simplistic TD-RL model for learning in mice. 
The models RPE of training and different environments resembles that of dopaminergic activity in the mice's striatum during learning.
